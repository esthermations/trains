# Trains

I like them. I don't really have any idea how to do this but I'd like to
simulate a railway network using SPARK-proven components, and then maybe prove
certain properties of that network.

Currently I've got some barebones building blocks here. The idea of a "track"
which is probably a segment of track between two semaphores, and movement
between tracks.

There are no physical rules yet about which tracks can be moved to from a given
track. Maybe I could make a junction type for that.
